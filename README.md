# square-checker
Project which came from a dumb coversation at work, about the fact that 13^2 is 169, and 31^2 is 961, so both the inputs and the outputs are reverses of each other..
Inefficiently checks the numbers between 1 and 100k (this can be changed), for whether the input, the input reversed, and both squares are reversed too.
